# PokeView: A Simple Way to Practice Coding with Pokémon

PokeView is a basic project for students learning to code. It uses the PokeAPI to show how you can retrieve and display information about Pokémon in a simple web application. This project is a great starting point for anyone new to working with APIs or interested in Pokémon.

# Key Points:

Basic API Usage: Learn how to make requests to the PokeAPI and display the results on a web page.

Simple Visualization: See how data from the API can be used to show Pokémon characteristics, such as names, types, and abilities, in a straightforward format.

Coding Practice: A good opportunity to practice async WebRequests and WPF basics by integrating them with real-world data.

# The Task:

Create a WPF application where you can search the PokéAPI for a specific Pokémon by name. Display your search result. Show the name, all abilities, type and the picture of the Pokémon.
If the Pokémon is not found, display a corresponding message.
By clicking on the picture, you should be able to toggle between Shiny variant and Normal.
